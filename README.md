A GNOME Shell extension (compatible with GNOME 45+) that automatically moves minimized windows to the last workspace/new workspace, keeping your current view clean. When unminimized, the window intelligently returns to its original workspace.

## Features

- **Auto-Banish:** Minimized windows are instantly moved to the last available workspace.
- **Smart Restore:** The extension remembers the original workspace of each window and puts it back exactly where it was upon restoration.
- **Memory Efficient:** Uses WeakMaps to track windows without causing memory leaks.
